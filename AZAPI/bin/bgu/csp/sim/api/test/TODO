*DONE* move all html code to TestScenarioLogger 

*DONE* Test Scenario Data (THE HTML TEMPLATE) should be a resource in the API jar it should be writen down to a given folder (save-logs?)

* TestConsole should have an "Open Logs-Folder"

*DONE* Add About Section with the details about the images 

* bundle it up with michael code.

*DONE* The algorithm data is not being fetch

*DONE* need to design the test steps:
  sanity and correctness, for correctness we have to add support for expirement into the api - finish the sanity test first

*DONE* need an non disterbuted Branch and bound algorithm for comparison.

* need to finish designing the test expirement
  * for each problem that was finished / round (all perticipients on the same problem) an event should be thrown
  *DONE* the branch and bound result should be compared to the result of the algorithm 
  *DONE* on error the execution should stop and the log should pop

* TestLog 
  * when floating over sent message need to show its arguments
  *DONE* when clicking on message top should go back to the point it sent

*DONE* The test should check the new Result Object.

* the test data should be saved as json into the html - will remove chrome limitation and will add numerus possibilities
