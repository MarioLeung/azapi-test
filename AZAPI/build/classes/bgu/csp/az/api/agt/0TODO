* AbstractAgent Should Support the auto statistics
* Simple Message and Abstract Agent can be combined if we remove the dependancy on the recepient in the message data 
* Abstract Agent should be consistent with the single unit of work paradigm by removing the 
  get message from its interface and instaed passing the message in the process function.
* i should consider merging the name conventions - abstract agent will change the init function to start message and simple agent should change processNextMessage to process(nextMessage)
